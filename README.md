## Inspiration
We created our project because finding a job can be tough and time-consuming. Our chatbot makes it easier by scanning resumes and connecting users with job opportunities and learning resources tailored to their skills and location.

## What it does
AI-powered chatbot designed to simplify the job search process. It scans resumes, identifies key information like skills and location, and then connects users with relevant job opportunities, internships, career fairs, and learning resources. It's a one-stop platform for job seekers to find and apply for positions while also offering educational courses to help them develop new skills and stay competitive in the job market.

## How we built it
We used React and Next.js to create the website, making it easy to navigate and use. We added special features like resume scanning and a chatbot to help with job searches. For the backend, we used tRPC and Prisma to handle data and connections and etc. And to make sure everything runs smoothly when we put it online, we set up different settings for different situations, like when it's testing or when it's live.

## Challenges we ran into
the frontend, managing the integration of various features like resume scanning and chatbot functionality into a cohesive user interface was a challenge. On the backend, overcoming complexities in the API implementation, particularly with tRPC and Prisma, required extensive debugging and problem-solving efforts.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
successfully integrating multiple technologies and implementing features like AI-powered resume scanning and chatbot functionality. Our commitment to designing a user-friendly interface and optimizing backend performance. We want to deliver a high-quality and scalable solution for job seekers.

## What we learned
Patience and for the backend navigating challenges with API implementation.
